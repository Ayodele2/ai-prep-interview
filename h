I'm a new coder who's struggling to land interviews, and I know basic CRUD apps and portfolio websites aren't enough anymore. I want to build three standout technically impressive projects that companies would genuinely be impressed Here's what I need from you. Analyze real junior and mid level software engineer job listings from LinkedIn well found in other job boards. Identify the top in demand skills and problems companies are hiring to solve. Based on that, give me three unique project ideas that meet these criteria. Each project needs to solve real world problems and provide actual value to users. It uses industry relevant tech. It includes at least one technically difficult feature like real time collaboration, data visualization, AI powered automation, multi step work flows, etcetera. The end result should be something that looks like a real start up MVP. For each project, include one sentence description, a real world use case, a full tech stack, advanced features that show off technical depth, a short description on how to pitch it on a resume to make recruiters interested. Do not suggest generic projects like to do lists, blogs, weather apps, or clones unless they're solving a real user problem in a unique useful way.
